\section{Symbolic Trajectory Evaluation}

\textit{Symbolic trajectory evaluation}~\cite{seger1995} (STE) is a high-performance model checking technique based on \textit{symbolic simulation} extended with a temporal \textit{next-time} operator to describe circuit behaviour over time. In its simplest form, STE tests the validity of an \textit{assertion} of the form $A \Rightarrow C$, where both the \textit{antecedent} $A$ and \textit{consequent} $C$ are formulas in the following logic:

\begin{equation*}
f ::= p \: | \: f \wedge f \: | \: P \rightarrow f \: | \: \Next f
\end{equation*}

\noindent Here, $p$ is a simple predicate over ``values'' in a circuit and $P$ is a Boolean propositional formula, and the operators $\wedge$, $\rightarrow$ and $\Next$ are conjunction, domain restriction and the next-time operator, respectively.

If the circuit contains Boolean signals, $p$ is typically drawn from the following two predicates: $n \Is 1$ and $n \Is 0$, where $n$ ranges over the signals (or nodes) in a circuit. For example, suppose we have a unit-delayed, two-input AND-gate, then it is reasonable to assume that the assertion $(\mathit{in_{1}} \Is 1 \wedge \mathit{in_{2}} \Is 1) \Rightarrow \Next (\mathit{out} \Is 1)$ is true. Indeed, STE efficiently validates such statements for us.

While the truth semantics of an assertion in STE is defined as the satisfaction of its ``defining'' trajectory (bounded sequence of states) relative to a model structure of the circuit, what the STE algorithm computes is exactly the solution of a data-flow equation~\cite{chou1999} in the classic format~\cite{muchnick1997}. \dots

% translate an STE assertion into a linear, directed graph \dots introducing as many states as the assertion is deep \dots labelling each state with the antecedent and consequent at that depth. \dots

% We adopt this reimagined STE as data flow analysis~\cite{chou1999}, in which trajectory assertions can have arbitrary state-transition graphs. The following sections give a short introduction to its mathematical foundation.
